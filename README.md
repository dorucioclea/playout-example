# 24/7 Stream example

- Uses [Owncast](https://owncast.online) as the streaming server.
- Uses [ffplayout](https://github.com/ffplayout/ffplayout) as the playout client.

## Content

Add videos into the `videos` directory to have them play.

## Run

This playout example uses Docker to run these two services together.

`docker-compose up`

## Disclaimer

This is just an example of how you can build a 24/7 stream using Owncast and some playout software. You will want to customize the settings, logo, quality and other settings to meet your requirements.
